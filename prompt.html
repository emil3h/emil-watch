            <h2>Prompt:</h2>
            <div class="prompt-text">I want to create a simple website that servers as a showcase of my favorite watches, watches that I would like to purchase in the future. Its kinda like a wish list. I want to have  a list with cards for each watch, the cards will have one image of the watch plus the name of it as a title below the image. 
<br><br>It should be a scrollable list with the abiotly to click on each watch card to view more details about the watch like the price, movement, and website link. I want to be able to sort by the brands on the list page. 
<br><br>For that I want you to Create a horizontally scrollable iOS-style segmented control at the top. Each segment is a rounded pill button. One segment is active at a time. Clicking a segment should visually update the active pill AND filter the list of car cards below so only items for that brand are shown. 
<br><br>The site should be responisve and work on mobile and desktop to accomodate any screen size. I want to host this site using github pages. use vanilla html css and js for now</div>
